Pose Correction Video Processor

This Python project processes a video to detect and analyze the angles of specific joints in a person’s body using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It then provides recommendations for adjustments if joint angles differ significantly from reference angles, overlaying this information directly onto the video frames.

Features

	•	Pose Detection: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track human poses in each frame of the video.
	•	Angle Calculation: Calculates the angles at the elbows and shoulders.
	•	Angle Comparison: Compares detected angles with predefined reference angles to determine if they are within acceptable thresholds.
	•	Recommendations Overlay: Displays corrective suggestions on the video if a detected angle exceeds the specified threshold.
	•	Video Output: Saves a new version of the input video with recommendations displayed as overlays.

Setup

Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

	•	OpenCV: For video processing
	•	MediaPipe: For pose estimation
	•	NumPy: For mathematical calculations

You can install these libraries via pip:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

Files

	•	cap.mp4: Input video file.
	•	processed_video.mp4: Output video file with overlaid recommendations.
	•	pose_processor.py: Main Python script that processes the video.

Usage

Set the Input Video Path:

Place your video file in the specified location or change the cap_user variable in the script to the path of your video file.

Run the Script:

Run the script by executing:

python pose_processor.py

Check the Output:

After the script completes, check the processed_video.mp4 to see the recommendations overlaid on the video.

Reference Angles and Thresholds

The script checks angles for:

	•	Left Elbow
	•	Right Elbow
	•	Left Shoulder
	•	Right Shoulder

Reference Angles:

	•	Left and Right Elbows: 90°
	•	Left and Right Shoulders: 45°

Angle Threshold:

	•	10° difference from the reference angle triggers a recommendation.

You can adjust the reference_angles and threshold values in the script as needed.

Customizing Recommendations

The recommendations appear on the video if any joint angle deviates from the reference by more than the threshold. Modify the recommendations section in the script if you want to add or adjust feedback.

Example Output

Each frame in the output video shows the user with pose landmarks, angles, and any recommendations for adjustment.
